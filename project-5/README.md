### Leetcode clone
Leetcode is a website that lets you practice coding problems. It also lets you see the solutions of other people.

The basic function requirements
- Let the user sign up and login
- Let the user see existing problems
- Let the user sort problems by difficulty
- Bonus points if you can create an admin dashboard where admins can add problems and test cases

### Backend Service
- Simple backend that lets users sign up and sign in (users table)
- Lets users see existing problems (problems table)
- Lets users submit problems. You need to create a judge that evaluates the users code with the test cases stored in the DB

### Frontend service
- A simple frontend in react similar to the leetcode website. You can use any UI framework you want, but I would recommend using tailwindcss.
